### Quick Screening Questions

- Technical Test: 10 world-class engineers could not fully replicate Rubrik in 6 months due to enterprise integration and scale, but could build a basic version. Pass, but not a deep tech moat.
- Business Test: Rubrik is likely achieving Rule of 40+ (41% growth + positive FCF margin). Pass.
- 10x Test: 10x in 10 years is possible but would require sustained high growth and margin expansion. Possible, but not certain.
- Moat Test: Becoming irrelevant would require a major shift in enterprise data security paradigms or a catastrophic breach. Moat is solid but not unassailable.
- Price Test: Valuation is ~16.7x sales for 41% growth (~0.4x growth rate multiple). Fair, not cheap.

### Red Flags

- Net losses remain high (~$524M TTM).
- No evidence of founder departure or customer concentration in available data.
- Competitive market with large incumbents (e.g., Veeam, Cohesity, Commvault).

### Green Flags

- Founder-led, high insider ownership (Bipul Sinha, CEO and co-founder).
- Leader in Gartner Magic Quadrant for six years.
- Positive free cash flow milestone.
- Expanding TAM with AI/data security focus.

--

### Reference Company Comparison

- Most similar to: Palantir and Databricks (mission-critical enterprise software, strong but not unassailable technical moat, high growth, fair-to-expensive valuation).

Summary:

Rubrik scores 11/20â€”placing it in the "Watch list" category. It is a high-quality, mission-critical enterprise software company with strong growth, improving cash flow, and a solid market position, but lacks deep technical breakthroughs and trades at a fair (not bargain) valuation."""
