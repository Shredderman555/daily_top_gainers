# Sample evaluation text
sample_evaluation = """Rocket Lab scores 12/20 (Buy â€“ good opportunity). It resembles Anduril in defense-driven systems.

Part A: Technical Excellence (0-8)

1) Fundamental Technical Innovation: 1/2
- Rocket Lab's core innovations are in reliable, high-cadence small launch (Electron)
- The firm demonstrates incremental but meaningful innovation

2) Technical Complexity & Barriers: 2/2
- Orbital launch, booster recovery/reuse across multiple domains
- Compounding advantages from vertical integration

3) Technical Risk & Systems Mastery: 1/2
- The Neutron medium-lift program adds genuine technical risk
- Demonstrated systems integration but not yet at SpaceX scale

4) Irreplaceable Technical Assets: 2/2
- Two launch sites (New Zealand and Virginia)
- Vertically integrated manufacturing capabilities

Subtotal Part A: 6/8

Part B: Business Power (0-12)

5) Revenue Quality & Durability: 1/2
- Space Systems now the larger revenue driver
- Multi-year defense contracts provide visibility

6) Market Position & Competitive Dynamics: 1/2
- Leading position in small-launch market
- Growing space systems business

7) Growth & Profitability Runway: 2/4
- 36% YoY revenue growth with margin expansion
- Path to profitability visible but not yet achieved

8) Capital Efficiency & Cash Generation: 1/2
- Still cash consumptive but improving metrics
- Heavy capex for Neutron development

9) Valuation Reality: 1/2
- Trading at reasonable multiples for growth
- Not in bubble territory

Subtotal Part B: 6/12

Total Score: 12/20

Quick Screening

- Technical Test: Could 10 engineers replicate in 6 months? No
- Business Test: Will they achieve Rule of 40? Not yet
- Growth Test: 30%+ growth for 5 years? Maybe
- Moat Test: Strong competitive position? Yes
- Price Test: Valuation < 2x growth? Yes

Red Flags (not scored)
- Continued losses through 2026
- Neutron schedule and execution risk
- Competitive pressure from SpaceX

Green Flags (not scored)
- Founder-led by Peter Beck
- Strong defense tailwinds
- Record quarterly revenue growth

Closest Resemblance
Most similar to Anduril with elements of SpaceX manufacturing ambition

Score Breakdown
Technical: 6/8, Business: 6/12, Total: 12/20

What would change the score upward
Neutron first flight success and customer uptake would add 2-3 points"""
